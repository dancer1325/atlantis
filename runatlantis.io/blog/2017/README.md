- Main original purposes
    - effective collaboration
    - empower developers
        - BUT without giving credentials previous to approve

- Terraform workflows
    - just using master
      - `terraform â€¦` locally
      - Problems
          - NO collaboration
          - NO code review
    - PR
      - using PR branch
        - `terraform plan` locally
          - once PR approved â†’ `terraform apply`
      - Problems
        - difficult to estimate the diff
          - **Reason:** ðŸ§ There is NO `terraform plan` â€™s output ðŸ§ 
        - master is outsync whatâ€™s been applied
          - **Reason:** ðŸ§ `terraform apply` could fail & master NOT been aware of that ðŸ§ 
    - Atlantis workflow
      - problems of previous approaches are fixed
